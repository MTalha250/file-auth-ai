CASE NO. 67a0a180e301cade830c80dd 
 
AVIATION ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION 
 
BETWEEN:-
KATERINA DAVIES & 2 OTHERS
Passengers
- and -
EASYJET AIRLINE COMPANY LIMITED
Airline
DEFENCE STATEMENT
PRELIMINARIES
1. 
Unless stated otherwise, all times referred to in this statement and any exhibits are in
Universal Coordinated Time (“UTC”).
2. 
This case concerns the delay to flight EZY2230 scheduled to depart from Manchester
Airport (MAN) at 07:05 on 04 January 2025 and scheduled to arrive at Václav Havel
Airport Prague (PRG) at 09:15 on 04 January 2025 (the “Flight”).
3. 
The Airline will address the Passengers’ claim for compensation in accordance with the Air
Passenger Rights and Air Travel Organisers’ Licensing (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations
2019 (the APR) which is otherwise interchangeably referred to as Regulation EC 261/2004
(the Regulation), as amended by the APR in accordance with Section 3 of the European
Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.
4. 
The Airline further reserves the right to plead further and/or amend its Defence submissions
upon the receipt of any further evidence from the Passengers.
AGREED FACTS
5. 
The Airline agrees that:
5.1 
The claim falls within the scope of the Regulation;
1

==================================================


=== PAGE 2 ===

[IMAGE 1]
easyJet
5.2 
For the purposes of Article 3(2) of the Regulation, the Passengers held a confirmed
reservation on the Flight; and
5.3 
The Flight was delayed on arrival by 3 or more hours.
POINTS OF DISPUTE
6. 
The Airline denies that it is liable to pay compensation pursuant to Regulation (EC) No.
261/2004 (the “Regulation”) or otherwise and relies on Article 5(3) of the Regulation on the
basis that:
6.1 
the Flight was disrupted as a result of extraordinary circumstances; and
6.2 
the Airline took all reasonable measures to mitigate the disruption to the Flight or
there were no such measures that could be taken by Airline in the circumstances.
7. 
As such, the right to compensation is excluded by reference to Article 5(3) of the Regulation
if a carrier can prove that, the disruption was caused by extraordinary circumstances and that
that disruption could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken.
FACTUAL MATRIX
8. 
The Flight was scheduled to operate on a UK-registered Airbus A321 bearing tail registration
G-UZMJ (the “Aircraft”).

9. 
Prior to the Flight, the Aircraft was scheduled to operate operated EZY2229 (the Preceding
Flight) which was delayed on departure due to fuelling discrepancies at MAN. The
investigation revealed that the fuel discrepancy resulted from an error by the airport fuelling
provider, and no technical defects were reported with the aircraft itself.
10. 
Prior to EZY2229 there were no delays or disruptions to the original aircraft.
11. 
However, given the potential safety implications of these discrepancies on the Aircraft’s
operation, the Captain, as the commanding officer, determined that, in the circumstance, the
safest course of action was to operate with a replacement aircraft, which was positioned from
the Airline's base at LGW.

13. 
As the report indicates, fuel readings indicated excessive fuel on-board, which presents a
safety risk as all aircraft parameters are carefully measured in order to ensure safe flight
operations in accordance with both industry standards and technical demands.
14. 
Consequently, in the interest of the safety of passengers and crew, and as a reasonable
measure, the Preceding Flight was relocated to another aircraft, this time an Airbus A321
bearing tail registration G-UZMC (the Replacement Aircraft), which was positioned from
London Gatwick Airport (LGW), arriving at MAN at 12:31.

19. 
Had it not been for the fuel reading discrepancies, which presented the operating Captain with
safety concerns, the Flight would have, in all likelihood, been able to operate as per the
schedule.
20. 
Taking into account the circumstances that led to the disruption, the Airline avers that, by
having sourced a rescue aircraft to operate the rotation, all adequate reasonable measures
were taken to ensure the safety of the passengers and crew and the integrity of the Aircraft
was prioritised, while also avoiding cancelling the Flight.
LEGAL PRINCIPLES
EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES
21. 
In respect of extraordinary circumstances, Recital 14 of the Regulation states as follows:
“As under the Montreal Convention, obligations on operating air carriers should be limited
or excluded in cases where an event has been caused by extraordinary circumstances which
could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken. Such
circumstances may, in particular, occur in cases of political instability, meteorological
conditions incompatible with the operation of the flight concerned, security risks, unexpected
flight safety shortcomings and strikes that affect the operation of an operating air carrier.”
8

==================================================


=== PAGE 9 ===

[IMAGE 1]
easyJet
22. 
This is also consistent with the well-established test set out by the CJEU in various leading
authorities which considered the interpretation of Recital 14, namely that an event is covered
by the concept of ‘extraordinary circumstances’ where it is:
a) not inherent in the normal exercise of the activity of the air carrier concerned; and
b) beyond that carrier’s  actual control.
23. 
It is submitted that it is not inherent in the normal exercise of easyJet’s activities for
meteorological conditions to be incompatible with the operation of safe flight, whether that be
the flight concerned or a previous sector, nor is such an event within the actual control of
easyJet.  In the grand scheme of easyJet’s normal day-to-day activities, it is not a common or
ordinary occurrence for meteorological conditions to be so severe that they cause a flight to
be cancelled or subjected to a long delay.
24. 
Furthermore, the CJEU in Pešková and Peška v Travel Service A.S (Case C-315/15)
confirmed that the collision between an aircraft and a bird is something which must be
classified as ‘extraordinary circumstances’.  In reaching that decision, the CJEU gave clear
ratio decidendi in its judgment:
“a collision between an aircraft and a bird, as well as any damage caused by that collision,
since they are not intrinsically linked to the operating system of the aircraft, are not by their
nature or origin inherent in the normal exercise of the activity of the air carrier concerned
and are outside its actual control.” [Emphasis added]
25. 
The Airline relies on the Touristic Aviation Services Limited (‘TAS’) and Flightright GmbH
(Case C 405/23) of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “CJEU”) which ruled:
26. 
By its question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 5(3) of Regulation No
261/2004 must be interpreted as meaning that the fact of there being an insufficient number of
staff of the airport operator (…) may constitute an ‘extraordinary circumstance’ within the
meaning of that provision.
27. 
In the first place, so far as concerns the condition that the event in question must not be, by its
nature or origin, inherent in the normal exercise of the activity of the air carrier concerned, the
Court has held, as regards aircraft refuelling operations, that, even if those operations fall, in
principle, within the scope of the normal exercise of an air carrier’s activity, an issue which
arises during those operations and is the result of a general failure in the refuelling system
managed by the airport satisfies that condition since such an event cannot be regarded as

==================================================

easyJet
intrinsically linked to the operation of the aircraft which completed the delayed flight (see, to
that effect, judgment of 7 July 2022, SATA International – Azores Airlines (Failure of the
refuelling system), C 308/21, EU:C:2022:533, paragraphs 22 and 23).
28. 
This is also consistent with Touristic Aviation Services Limited (‘TAS’) and Flightright
GmbH (Case C 405/23) of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “CJEU”) which
held that, “Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of
the Council of 11 February 2004 establishing common rules on compensation and assistance
to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights, and
repealing Regulation (EEC) No 295/91, must be interpreted as meaning that the fact of there
being an insufficient number of staff of the airport operator responsible for the operations of
loading baggage onto planes may constitute an ‘extraordinary circumstance’ within the
meaning of that provision”.
29. 
According to the Court, the concept of “extraordinary circumstances” within the meaning of
Regulation No 261/2004 refers to events which, by their nature or origin, are not inherent in
the normal exercise of the activity of the air carrier concerned and are beyond its actual
control. More particularly, events whose origin is internal must be distinguished from those
whose origin is external to the air carrier, a concept encompassing those events which result
in part from the latter’s activity and from external circumstances which are more or less
frequent in practice but which an air carrier does not control because they arise from a natural
event or an act of a third party. All that being said, it is for the referring court to determine, in
light of the circumstances of the case in the main proceedings, whether the failures in the
ground handling operations at Cologne Bonn airport were beyond TAS’s control and, if so,
whether the latter has shown that those exceptional circumstances could not have been
avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken and whether it adopted measures
appropriate to the situation to avoid the consequences thereof.
30. 
It is submitted that the airport operator provides fuelling services and equipment, and that like
baggage loading, even if these operations fall, in principle, within the scope of the normal
exercise of the activity of an air carrier, an issue that arises during these operations resulting,
either from issues with staff or equipment managed by the airport satisfies that condition
cannot be regarded as intrinsically linked to the operation of the aircraft which completed the
delayed flight.

31. 
In light of the above, the Airline submits that the disruption to the Flight was caused by
extraordinary circumstances.
Safety Of An Aircraft
32. 
Pursuant to the Air Navigation Order 2016, Article 75(1), before commencing take-off, the
pilot in command is obligated to be satisfied that, based on the available information, the
conditions do not prevent a safe take-off and departure.
33. 
The safety of an aircraft is paramount, and ensuring the correct amount and type of fuel is
onboard is a critical aspect of flight operations. The captain, as the final authority on board,
must be fully satisfied that all fuel calculations are accurate and that there are no
discrepancies before departure.
34. 
Any discrepancy in the fuel load can compromise the aircraft’s performance and jeopardise
the safety of the flight. As part of their responsibility, the captain must ensure that the aircraft
is properly fuelled to meet the required operational range. If any uncertainty or inconsistency
arises in the fuel data, the captain is obligated to take precautionary measures to safeguard the
flight, which may include delaying the departure and/or opting for a replacement aircraft to
ensure the continued safety of the passengers and crew.
35. 
It is inconceivable that a pilot would compromise passenger safety by failing to address
discrepancies in the requested fuel and actual fuel on board, all in an attempt to avoid any
delay in the flight's departure..
36. 
Any issues with fuelling systems or providers are strictly regulated and fall entirely outside
the airline's control. The priorities in these circumstances are unequivocally focused on safety,
and any expectation to the contrary is wholly unreasonable.
37. 
In light of the above, the Airline submits that the disruption to the Flight was caused by
extraordinary circumstances.
REASONABLE MEASURES
38. 
In Eglitis v Latvijas Republikas Ekonomikas Ministrija (Case C-294/10) the Court of Justice
of the European Union (the “CJEU”) held that, while Article 5(3) includes a provision which
requires carriers to use all reasonable measures to avoid the disruption of flights, that
provision is limited to ensure that it "does not result in the air carrier being led to make
intolerable sacrifices in the light of the capacities of its undertaking at the relevant time".
11

39. 
Furthermore, in Wallentin-Hermann v Alitalia (Case C-549/07) the CJEU held that reasonable
measures must be “appropriate to the situation, that is to say measures which are, at the time
those extraordinary circumstances arise, meet, inter alia, conditions which are technically
and economically viable to the air carrier concerned”.
40. 
The Airline took all reasonable measures to avoid disruption by having spare aircraft and
crew within our network and utilising these assets as required to minimise disruption.
41. 
The Airline promptly sourced a spare aircraft from its base at LGW and positioned it to MAN
at the earliest opportunity. The positioned aircraft was staffed with the necessary crew, who
were called in from standby, for which the Airline has taken all steps to ensure compliance
with crew requirements.
42. 
It would be economically unviable for easyJet to maintain fully crewed redundant aircraft at
each and every airport to which it operates to or from, in sufficient number to cover any
number of potential disruptions.  Save for having an unlimited amount of spare aircraft and
crew at all airports, an option which would amount to an “intolerable sacrifice” given the
disproportionate cost involved, the disruption that materialised could not be avoided.
43. 
Accordingly, the Airline’s maintains that the measures taken were appropriate to the situation
and those that were technically and economically viable at the time and which mitigated the
inconvenience to the Passenger(s) as best as possible in the circumstances.  There were no
other reasonable measures which could have been taken to avoid the cause of the disruption
to the flight or the disruption itself.
GENERAL CONTINGENCIES
44. 
easyJet has a Fleet / Crew Optimisation and Allocation Team who are responsible for
managing the assignment of aircraft to activities, and this includes ensuring that the necessary
resilience is provided to the operation.  This is to ensure that the airline has sufficient
resources available at its disposal on a day-to-day basis in order to mitigate and manage
normal levels of disruption in peak summer periods.
45. 
easyJet’s general policy is to ensure that any delay, disruption and inconvenience to
passengers are minimised as much as possible, and in line with that policy, easyJet take
reasonable contingency precautions by ensuring that it has a proportionate number of spare
aircraft and crew available within its network.  easyJet aims to have a minimum of 1 standby
aircraft for every 20 – 25 aircraft within its fleet.  These aircraft are generally stationed
12

throughout easyJet’s primary aircraft bases including London Luton Airport (“LTN”),
London Gatwick Airport (“LGW”), Milan Malpensa Airport (“MXP”), Berlin Schönefeld
Airport (“SXF”), Geneva Airport (“GVA”) and Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (“CDG”).
This minimum standby aircraft plan is not always achievable on a day-to-day basis due to
overarching effects of ongoing, cumulative and unforeseeable disruption within the network
(e.g. the impact of industrial action / air traffic control restrictions on crew hours).  The
underlying cost of maintaining these resources equates to approximately £15 – 18 million per
annum (not including engineering and maintenance costs).  At the relevant time, easyJet
planned to have 1 standby aircraft for every 30 aircraft within its fleet which equated to
approximately 6 spare aircraft within the network.
46. 
easyJet also has crew bases in multiple locations throughout Europe.  easyJet aims to have a
minimum level of crew standby resources at its disposal on a day-to-day basis.  This
minimum crewing standby resource is calculated to equate to approximately 21% of the total
crew network (e.g. for every 100 Captains undertaking flying duties easyJet will have 21
standby Captains available within its network). The underlying cost of maintaining these
resources equates to approximately £70 – 80 million per annum.
47. 
As is the case with standby aircraft, this minimum standby crew plan is not always achievable
on a day-to-day basis due to overarching effects of ongoing, cumulative and unforeseeable
disruption within the network (e.g. the impact of industrial action / air traffic control
restrictions on crew hours).
Re-routing Options
48. 
It should be noted that, in the event of a delay, Article 6(1)(c) of the Regulation only entitles a
passenger to reimbursement only under Article 8(1)(a) (see Article 6(1)(c)(iii)).
49. 
The Passengers, however, did travel on the Flight, thereby utilising the service pursuant to the
flight contract, and as such, no refund is due.
Summary
50. 
The fuelling process is conducted by an independent airport service provider, either
contracted by the airport authority or operating as a separate entity.
51. 
The Airline has no control over the operational procedures, staffing, or maintenance of
equipment belonging to third-party fuelling companies. Consequently, any disruption arising
13

==================================================

easyJet
from such an external service provider constitutes an event beyond the Airline’s control, akin
to air traffic control restrictions or airport closures.
52. 
Pursuant to ECJ case law, notably C-549/07 Wallentin-Hermann, an event qualifies as an
extraordinary circumstance if:
52.1 
It originates externally to the airline’s normal operations, and
52.2 
It could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken.
53. 
A fuelling error, whether due to incorrect action taken by the third party, or a failure in the
refuelling system, is an unforeseeable and exceptional occurrence that the Airline cannot
reasonably anticipate or prevent.
54. 
Any fuelling discrepancy arising from the actions of airport personnel is attributable to a third
party and remains outside the airline’s sphere of management and control.
55. 
In the present case, the Aircraft captain acted in accordance with established safety protocols,
prioritising the welfare of passengers and crew. The Airline undertook all reasonable
measures to mitigate the delay, including sourcing a spare aircraft while the fuelling
discrepancy was being investigated.
56. 
Accordingly, under Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004, and the established case
law, the Airline is exempt from liability for compensation, as the delay resulted from
extraordinary circumstances that could not have been avoided despite all reasonable efforts.
CONCLUSION
57. 
In short, the Flight was delayed on arrival by 3 or more hours due to extraordinary
circumstances and there were no further measures that could have been taken by the Airline
to mitigate the disruption.
